The Rainbow:

Red
Yellow
Green
Blue
Indigo
Violet

These are the colours of the rainbow!
These are also the colours of the unicorn.
This is because, at the dawn of time
unicorns used rainbows exclusively for travel.
They evolved to match their natural environment,
allwing them to blend in and hide from prying eyes
